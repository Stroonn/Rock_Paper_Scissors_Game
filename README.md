# Rock Paper Scissors Game  

This project was built as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) Foundations course.  
It is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game implemented with **JavaScript**, playable through the browser console.

---

## Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to practice **JavaScript fundamentals**, such as:
- Variables and functions
- Conditionals and loops
- Random number generation
- DOM integration (future phase)

Currently, the game runs entirely in the **console**.

---

## How It Works  

1. The player chooses **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors** using a `prompt()`.  
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.  
3. The game compares the choices and displays the result for each round.  
4. After **5 rounds**, the total scores are displayed and a final winner is declared.

## What I Learned  

- How to use **functions** to organize logic into smaller pieces.  
- How to generate random outcomes with `Math.random()`.  
- How to handle user input with `prompt()` and basic string manipulation.  
- How to use **loops** and **conditional statements** to control game flow.  
- Basics of debugging using the **browser console**.
